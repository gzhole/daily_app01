# Career-Compounder Daily Routine

This master workflow guides you through your complete 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.

## Overview
The "30-minute Career-Compounder" consists of 5 blocks:
1. Scan 🔎 (8 min) - Read new items in your professional space
2. Capture 🗒️ (5 min) - Write two-sentence takeaways from the scan
3. Micro-Lab ⚙️ (10 min) - Advance an ongoing micro-project
4. Share 🌐 (4 min) - Post a concise LinkedIn update
5. Plan ✅ (3 min) - Jot tomorrow's next "smallest step"

## Steps

1. I'll help you start your Career-Compounder session by running through each block in sequence.

2. To begin the Scan block, I'll call the scan workflow:
   - Call /career-compounder-scan

3. After completing the Scan block, I'll move on to the Capture block:
   - Call /career-compounder-capture

4. Next, I'll guide you through the Micro-Lab block:
   - Call /career-compounder-microlab

5. After that, we'll tackle the Share block:
   - Call /career-compounder-share

6. Finally, I'll wrap up with the Plan block:
   - Call /career-compounder-plan

7. Once all blocks are completed, I'll record today's completion in your streak tracker:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Gary/development/daily_app01/career_compounder && node streak-tracker.js record
   ```
   
   This will update your streak, show you your progress, and provide encouraging feedback!

Remember, the momentum matters more than the exact timing. The goal is consistent daily progress that compounds over time.
