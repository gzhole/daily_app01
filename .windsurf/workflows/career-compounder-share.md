# Career-Compounder Share

This workflow guides you through the fourth block (Share üåê) of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.

## Steps

1. I'll help you reflect on what you've learned or accomplished today during your Career-Compounder session, focusing on:
   - Key insights from the Scan and Capture blocks
   - Progress made during the Micro-Lab block
   - Any connections between these elements

2. Based on this reflection, I'll help you draft a concise LinkedIn post following this format:
   - "Today I explored [topic]‚Äîhere's the key insight: [1-2 sentences]. [Optional link] #[relevant hashtag]"

3. We'll refine the post to ensure it's:
   - Professional and insightful
   - Concise yet valuable
   - Includes an appropriate hashtag to increase visibility
   - Includes relevant links if applicable

4. Once finalized, I'll save your post to the linkedin-posts.md file with today's date.

5. I'll remind you when we're at the 3-minute mark so you can wrap up this block and prepare for the "Plan" block.

Remember, this Share block should take approximately 4 minutes of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.
