# Career-Compounder Streak

This workflow helps you track and celebrate your Career-Compounder consistency.

## Steps

1. I'll check your current streak and progress:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Gary/development/daily_app01/career_compounder && node streak-tracker.js status
   ```

2. I'll ask if you'd like to record today's completion.

3. If you choose to record completion:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Gary/development/daily_app01/career_compounder && node streak-tracker.js record
   ```

4. I'll offer encouragement based on your current streak and progress.
