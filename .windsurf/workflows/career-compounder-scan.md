# Career-Compounder Scan

This workflow guides you through the first block (Scan ðŸ”Ž) of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.

## Steps

1. First, I'll ask you: What specific area within your field would you like to focus on today? (e.g., "cloud security vulnerabilities", "LLM prompt injection techniques", "OWASP Top-10 updates")

2. I'll search the web for the latest developments in your specified area from the past 24-48 hours. We'll focus on high-quality sources like:
   - Papers with Code â€“ Security filter
   - OWASP Top-10 resources
   - GitHub security advisories
   - Cloud provider security bulletins
   - Relevant CVE feeds

3. I'll present you with 2-3 of the most significant findings, including:
   - A brief summary of each item
   - Why it's relevant to your field
   - A direct link to the source

4. For each interesting item, I'll ask if you'd like to bookmark it for deeper study later and help you capture the essence of why it's worth revisiting.

5. I'll remind you when we're at the 7-minute mark so you can wrap up this block and prepare for the "Capture" block.

Remember, this Scan block should take approximately 8 minutes of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.
