# Career-Compounder Micro-Lab

This workflow guides you through the third block (Micro-Lab ⚙️) of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.

## Steps

1. I'll help you review your active micro-projects from the projects.md file to choose one to focus on today.

2. Based on your selection, I'll help identify a small, achievable task that can be completed within the 10-minute timeframe, such as:
   - Writing a small code function or test
   - Extending an existing feature
   - Fixing a minor bug
   - Creating a simple demo or proof-of-concept

3. I'll assist you with implementation by:
   - Offering code snippets or solutions
   - Answering questions about implementation details
   - Helping debug issues that arise
   - Suggesting optimizations or alternatives

4. Once the small advancement is complete, I'll help document what was accomplished in your projects.md file.

5. I'll remind you when we're at the 9-minute mark so you can wrap up this block and prepare for the "Share" block.

Remember, this Micro-Lab block should take approximately 10 minutes of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.
