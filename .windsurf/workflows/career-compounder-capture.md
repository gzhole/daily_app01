# Career-Compounder Capture

This workflow guides you through the second block (Capture üóíÔ∏è) of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.

## Steps

1. First, I'll help you review the key findings from the Scan block to ensure they're fresh in your mind.

2. For each significant finding, I'll help you craft a concise two-sentence takeaway following this format:
   - "Today I learned: [key insight]. This matters because [implication]."

3. I'll focus on highlighting:
   - The practical implications for your work
   - Connections to projects or skills you're developing
   - Potential impacts on your industry or specialty

4. Once you're happy with the takeaways, I'll append them to your knowledge-base.md file with today's date for future reference.

5. I'll remind you when we're at the 4-minute mark so you can wrap up this block and prepare for the "Micro-Lab" block.

Remember, this Capture block should take approximately 5 minutes of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.
