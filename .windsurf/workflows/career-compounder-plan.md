# Career-Compounder Plan

This workflow guides you through the fifth and final block (Plan âœ…) of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.

## Steps

1. I'll help you review the progress made today in your micro-project from the Micro-Lab block.

2. Based on this progress, we'll identify the smallest meaningful next step you can take tomorrow, focusing on:
   - Tasks that build directly on today's progress
   - Actions that are small enough to complete in tomorrow's 10-minute Micro-Lab block
   - Steps with clear success criteria

3. I'll help you formulate this step in an actionable format:
   - "[Verb] + [specific task] + [clear success criteria]"
   - For example: "Implement error handling for the user input validation function so it returns descriptive error messages"

4. Once finalized, I'll update your projects.md file with this next step under the appropriate project.

5. I'll remind you that this completes your Career-Compounder routine for today and suggest shutting everything down.

Remember, this Plan block should take approximately 3 minutes of your 30-minute Career-Compounder routine.
