# Career-Compounder Captures

## June 29, 2025

### 1. EPSS v4 and Vulnerability Trends
EPSS v4 was released in March 2025 with improved vulnerability scoring, while 2024 is projected to see 34,650 vulnerabilities, continuing the upward trend in software vulnerabilities.

**This matters because:** Understanding these trends helps prioritize vulnerability management efforts and informs security strategies for the coming year.

### 2. CVSS Vector Patterns
The most common vulnerability pattern for 2024 is network-accessible vulnerabilities with high impact (CVSS: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), highlighting the continued importance of network security controls.

**This matters because:** Recognizing these patterns allows for more targeted security controls and better resource allocation in vulnerability management programs.

### 1. AI Coding Assistant Landscape
The AI coding assistant landscape has evolved significantly with the introduction of Claude Code and Gemini CLI, each offering unique strengths for different development workflows.

**This matters because:** Understanding these tools' capabilities helps me choose the right one for specific tasks in my Career-Compounder routine, potentially saving time and improving code quality.

### 2. Tool Strengths: Claude Code vs Gemini CLI
Claude Code excels at agentic coding tasks like complex refactoring and test-driven development, while Gemini CLI offers powerful terminal-based automation with Google ecosystem integration.

**This matters because:** I can leverage Claude Code for complex coding tasks during my Micro-Lab block and Gemini CLI for automation scripts, making my development workflow more efficient.

### 3. Contextual Tool Selection
The choice of coding assistant should be based on specific needs: Claude Code for agentic capabilities, Gemini CLI for terminal workflows, and Cursor for full IDE experience.

**This matters because:** This insight helps me make informed decisions about tool selection based on the specific requirements of each Career-Compounder block.
