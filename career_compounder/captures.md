# Career-Compounder Captures

## June 28, 2025

### 1. AI Coding Assistant Landscape
The AI coding assistant landscape has evolved significantly with the introduction of Claude Code and Gemini CLI, each offering unique strengths for different development workflows.

**This matters because:** Understanding these tools' capabilities helps me choose the right one for specific tasks in my Career-Compounder routine, potentially saving time and improving code quality.

### 2. Tool Strengths: Claude Code vs Gemini CLI
Claude Code excels at agentic coding tasks like complex refactoring and test-driven development, while Gemini CLI offers powerful terminal-based automation with Google ecosystem integration.

**This matters because:** I can leverage Claude Code for complex coding tasks during my Micro-Lab block and Gemini CLI for automation scripts, making my development workflow more efficient.

### 3. Contextual Tool Selection
The choice of coding assistant should be based on specific needs: Claude Code for agentic capabilities, Gemini CLI for terminal workflows, and Cursor for full IDE experience.

**This matters because:** This insight helps me make informed decisions about tool selection based on the specific requirements of each Career-Compounder block.
