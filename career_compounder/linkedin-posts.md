ðŸš€ Just explored DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) and built a basic Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) from scratch! 

Key takeaways:
â€¢ AIxCC is pioneering AI-powered vulnerability detection and patching at scale
â€¢ CRS combines static analysis, pattern matching, and automated fixes
â€¢ The future of cybersecurity is automated, with AI handling routine security tasks

Built a simple CRS in Python that identifies security issues and suggests fixes. The most fascinating insight? The competition weights effective patchin
