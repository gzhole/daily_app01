- Today I learned: Attackers are now embedding malicious prompts within images that accompany benign text in multimodal LLMs. This matters because it represents a significant evolution in prompt injection techniques that bypasses traditional text-based security defenses.
- Today I learned: RAG systems are increasingly being targeted for indirect prompt injection via vector databases. This matters because as RAG becomes standard in enterprise LLM deployments, this threatens any system that uses external knowledge bases.
- Today I learned: Advanced attackers are using payload splitting methods where malicious prompts are divided across multiple inputs. This matters because fragments can bypass security filters that scan for suspicious content since they appear harmless in isolation.

### 2025-06-14
- Today I learned: Setting up a Career-Compounder system with Windsurf rules is more efficient than building a full app. This matters because it leverages existing AI capabilities without additional development overhead.
- Today I learned that Mitel MiCollab contains a critical path traversal vulnerability exploitable without authentication. This matters because unauthenticated remote access vulnerabilities represent the highest risk category for organizations, allowing attackers to potentially compromise entire communication systems with minimal effort.
- Today I learned that even security products like Trend Micro's Apex Central and Endpoint Encryption have critical remote code execution vulnerabilities. This matters because compromise of security management systems can provide attackers with a strategic foothold to disable or bypass an organization's entire defensive infrastructure.
- Today I learned that Palo Alto Networks patched seven privilege escalation vulnerabilities across their product line. This matters because timely patching of network security infrastructure is essential to prevent attackers from gaining elevated permissions that could compromise entire network segments.
