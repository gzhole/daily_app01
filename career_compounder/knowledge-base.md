- Today I learned: MCP's "line jumping" vulnerability allows malicious servers to execute attacks during the tool listing phase, before any tools are invoked. This matters because it bypasses core security boundaries and can lead to code exfiltration or vulnerability insertion without triggering security controls.
- Today I learned: The MCP architecture's security model can be compromised through tool poisoning attacks, where malicious tool descriptions manipulate model behavior. This matters because it undermines the protocol's security guarantees and requires additional verification layers when implementing MCP clients.
- Today I learned: Attackers can use MCP servers to create indirect communication channels between isolated components, violating the principle of least privilege. This matters because it expands the attack surface and requires network-level controls to prevent cross-server exploitation.
### 2025-06-16
- Today I learned: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is vulnerable to a new genetic algorithm-based attack called GAPMA that can subtly manipulate tool preferences in AI agents. This matters because as MCP becomes the standard for AI agent interoperability in 2025, these stealthy manipulations could redirect traffic and decisions without obvious signs of compromise.
- Today I learned: Effective MCP security requires defense-in-depth approaches including gateway architectures and Enhanced Tool Definition Interface (ETDI) extensions. This matters because implementing these controls can prevent tool poisoning and credential theft while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MCP valuable for AI agent ecosystems.
### 2025-06-15
- Today I learned: Attackers are now embedding malicious prompts within images that accompany benign text in multimodal LLMs. This matters because it represents a significant evolution in prompt injection techniques that bypasses traditional text-based security defenses.
- Today I learned: RAG systems are increasingly being targeted for indirect prompt injection via vector databases. This matters because as RAG becomes standard in enterprise LLM deployments, this threatens any system that uses external knowledge bases.
- Today I learned: Advanced attackers are using payload splitting methods where malicious prompts are divided across multiple inputs. This matters because fragments can bypass security filters that scan for suspicious content since they appear harmless in isolation.

### 2025-06-14
- Today I learned: Setting up a Career-Compounder system with Windsurf rules is more efficient than building a full app. This matters because it leverages existing AI capabilities without additional development overhead.
- Today I learned that Mitel MiCollab contains a critical path traversal vulnerability exploitable without authentication. This matters because unauthenticated remote access vulnerabilities represent the highest risk category for organizations, allowing attackers to potentially compromise entire communication systems with minimal effort.
- Today I learned that even security products like Trend Micro's Apex Central and Endpoint Encryption have critical remote code execution vulnerabilities. This matters because compromise of security management systems can provide attackers with a strategic foothold to disable or bypass an organization's entire defensive infrastructure.
- Today I learned that Palo Alto Networks patched seven privilege escalation vulnerabilities across their product line. This matters because timely patching of network security infrastructure is essential to prevent attackers from gaining elevated permissions that could compromise entire network segments.
