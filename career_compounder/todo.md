## Completed
- [x] Explore DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC)
  - https://aicyberchallenge.com/
- [x] Build basic Cyber Reasoning System (CRS)
- [x] Enhanced vulnerability scanner with prototype pollution detection (2025-06-23)
  - Added comprehensive detection patterns for prototype pollution
  - Implemented false positive reduction
  - Created test cases for various attack vectors

## Next Steps
### Today's Task (2025-06-30)
- [ ] Research EPSS v4's new features and document key changes from v3
  - Review EPSS v4 documentation and release notes
  - Identify improvements over v3
  - Document impact on vulnerability prioritization
  - Prepare test cases for implementation

### Tomorrow's Task (2025-07-01)
- [ ] Add test cases for enhanced prototype pollution detection
  - Create 5+ test cases for new patterns
  - Add benchmark for performance impact (<2% regression)
  - Update README with new patterns and usage
  - Document auto-fix suggestions for common patterns
- [ ] Fix unhandled promise rejections in EPSS test suite
  - Add proper error handling for async tests
  - Ensure all promises are properly awaited
  - Verify no unhandled rejections in test output
